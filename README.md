# HauzeoTest
A test page design
1. Make a new folder somewhere on the system.
2. Download the index.html, style.css, and script.js files.
3. Download the assesst folder and keep all files within the original and the live.


//Functionalities implemented:
1. Header & Navigation
      Used media queries to handle responsiveness:
      On iPad/tablet view, the center navigation is hidden for better spacing.
      On smaller screen sizes, a hamburger menu is implemented, allowing the navigation to open smoothly.
2. Filter Bar
      Added dropdowns for Sale Status and Price as required
      Implemented hover effects on all filter inputs
      Added a Sort By active dropdown for display purposes.
3. Map Section
      Integrated a map using an iframe on the left side for desktop view.
      The layout adjusts on mobile devices, where the map collapses behind the property listings on smaller screen .
4. Property Cards Designed
      Property cards based on the Figma layout.
      Implemented an image slider inside each card with multiple images.
      Navigation arrows and indicators appear on hover.
      Included all required property details such as price, type, address, beds, baths,and days on market.
5. Hover Effects & Animations
        Added a box-shadow hover effect on the entire property card to emphasize interaction.
        Implemented a pulse animation on the heart (like) icon on hover.
